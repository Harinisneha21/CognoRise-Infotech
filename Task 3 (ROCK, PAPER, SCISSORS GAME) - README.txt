This Rock, Paper, Scissors game prompts users to select one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. It then generates a random choice for the computer. The game logic determines the winner based on the user's and computer's selections: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. The result is displayed to the user, showing both choices and whether the user wins, loses, or ties. Optionally, the game can track scores for both the user and the computer across multiple rounds. After each round, users are given the option to play again. The user interface is designed to be user-friendly, providing clear instructions and feedback throughout the game.
